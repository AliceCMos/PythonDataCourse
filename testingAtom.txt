This is to test how to push things to git from Atom.
In atom I can write text, but not modify other files.


Ok I saved the filename, let's see what we can do here.
I can add some more stuff here now to see if Atom opens git

So with atom I can commit changes, but I need Github
Desktop to push them to the repo.

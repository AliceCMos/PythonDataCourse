This is to test how to push things to git from Atom.
In atom I can write text, but not modify other files.


Ok I saved the filename, let's see what we can do here.
I can add some more stuff here now to see if Atom opens git

So with atom I can commit changes, but I need Github
Desktop to push them to the repo.
Ah no, I saw I can also directly push from Atom (buttom right push icon)
But I guess this only works for files I have edited here in the text editor.

But this editor also works for python code actually. And maybe also Arduino code.
Let's test arduino code!


Yes Arduino code looks really nice here.
